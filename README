All the dotfiles that I need to get up and running. To install just run
the install script in the root directory.

NOTE: on OS X you may need to do the following (hope to automate this later):

- `brew install ctags`
- `brew install hub`

If you want faster searching install the_silver_searcher. Vim should still successfully
load without this installed.
- `brew install the_silver_searcher`
